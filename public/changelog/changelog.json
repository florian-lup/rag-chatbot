      "In the last few days we added support for several new models, including OpenAI's GPT-5 and GPT-OSS 120B. GPT-5 offers significantly more intelligent responses and a more expressive writing style. OSS is fast and reliable - we’re so impressed with its performance vs Gemini Flash 2.5 that we made it the default model for free users.",
      "We also introduced GPT o3 and o4-mini with real-time “thinking process” and made major upgrades to existing models: Gemini 2.5 Flash now uses its advanced reasoning engine, also displaying thinking in real-time.",
      "The citation hover component in chat is now significantly more insightful. Instead of only showing the raw text from a source, we now generate an explanation of why that particular citation is relevant to the conversation. This summary, along with key quotes from the document, makes it much easier to verify the AI's reasoning without having to open and read the entire source document."
