Anara offers two types of chat experiences.\nWhen you start a chat from the home page, Anara provides intelligent responses by searching through academic databases, your personal library, and web sources to deliver comprehensive, research-backed answers to your questions. You can control this with the Context settings in the settings menu inside the input.\nWhen chatting directly with files or folders, Anara focuses specifically on the content you’re viewing, allowing for detailed questions about your research materials.",

When you ask a question from a folder, Anara responds based on all content found in the folder, drawing insights from every included file.\n​How to create folders\nThere are two ways to create folders in Anara:\n\nClick the + icon in the left sidebar, select “Folder” under the Create dropdown, and drag items into the folder, or\nSelect multiple items from the table and click “Add to folder”.\n\n​Subfolders\nA powerful feature in Anara is the ability to nest folders within other folders, creating a hierarchical organization. Each nested folder has its own AI assistant that responds based on the files within that specific folder, while parent folder assistants can access files across their entire hierarchy.\nWhen chatting with a folder, you can switch between table (default) and tab view. Table View displays all your documents and metadata at a glance, while Tabs View lets you open and compare papers side by side. If you click on a citation in a response, Anara will automatically switch to Tabs View and navigate to the relevant section in the source file.",

In these cases, Anara will always use information from the selected files or folders to generate responses.\n​Response length\nAdjust how detailed Anara’s answers are by using the length setting. Choose preset lengths from 50-500 words, select “No limit” for unrestricted responses, or use the default 120-word length (maximum for free users).\nFor custom word counts beyond preset options, select “No limit” and specify your desired length in your prompt (e.g., “Please respond in 800 words”).\nNote: Actual response lengths may vary by approximately 20% to ensure quality and completeness.\n​Language settings\nAnara supports over 90 languages including French, Spanish, German, Hindi, and Chinese. You can change your preferred language in either the chat settings menu or your account settings.\nNote: While our models support over 90 languages, our interface is currently only available in English.",
