      "content": "At Anara, safeguarding your data is our highest priority. We’ve designed our platform with security and privacy at its core. Below, you’ll find information on how we protect your data, our compliance efforts, and answers to common security questions.\nWe encourage responsible disclosure of any security vulnerabilities. Please send reports to security@anara.com, and our team will acknowledge and investigate promptly.\n​Compliance\nSOC 2 (in progress)We are actively working with an audit partner to achieve full SOC 2 Type 2 compliance. This ensures that Anara’s controls around security, availability, processing integrity, confidentiality, and privacy meet rigorous, industry-recognized standards.\nCCPACCPA (California Consumer Privacy Act): California residents have rights to access, delete, and opt out of the sale of their personal information. Refer to our Privacy Policy for details on exercising these rights.\n​Model Training\nAnara employs advanced language models to surface insights from your research materials.\n\nNo Third-Party Model Training: We never allow third-party AI providers (like OpenAI and Anthropic) to train their models on your private or proprietary data.\nNo Internal Model Training: Your data is never used to train any AI models within Anara. We do not use your information for internal model development.\n\n​Data Encryption\n​Encryption at Rest\nOur data security measures include multiple layers of encryption: our primary database uses AES-256 (or equivalent) encryption for all user and application data, which is hosted in US-based data centers. Uploaded files and media are protected in encrypted object storage buckets with server-side encryption, also located in US regions. Additionally, we employ managed in-memory data stores for caching and session data, all of which remains encrypted at rest using industry-standard algorithms.\n​Encryption in Transit\nAll data transmitted to and from Anara is protected using industry-standard encryption protocols. We enforce TLS 1.2 or higher across our entire infrastructure, including web app access, API calls, database connections, object storage, CDN delivery, and internal service communications. This ensures that all data remains private and secure while in transit, with automatic rejection of any non-encrypted connection attempts.\n​Access Control\n​Role-Based Access\nWe implement strict role-based access controls (RBAC) at both the application and infrastructure levels. Only authorized personnel have the minimum permissions required to perform their jobs. Database credentials, API keys, and production secrets are stored in encrypted secret-management services with fine-grained access policies.\n​Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)\nAll Anara employees with access to production systems are required to use MFA (with hardware tokens or authenticator apps). For organizations using Anara’s Enterprise tier, we offer Single Sign-On (SSO) via SAML 2.0 or OAuth2, integrating seamlessly with popular identity providers. MFA is enforced at the identity provider level.\n​Data Retention\n\nData Deletion: You have full control over your data. At any time, you can delete individual folders, files, or your entire account. Once deleted, content is purged from our database and object storage within 30 days.\nData Export: To request an export of your files, folders and library data, email support@anara.com. We’ll prepare a downloadable ZIP containing your raw files and database exports.\nRetention Policies:\n\nActive Data: Stored indefinitely until you choose to delete.\nBackups: Daily encrypted backups of your database are retained for 30 days, after which they’re permanently deleted.\nLogs: Application logs and audit trails are stored for 90 days and then automatically purged or aggregated.\n\n\n\n​Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)\nCan I export my project data and attachments?Yes. You can request a data export by emailing support@anara.com. We’ll prepare a downloadable ZIP file containing all your files, folders and library data.How do you protect my data if I share a project with teammates?Access controls are enforced at the application layer. When you share a folder, only explicitly invited users (by email address) can view or edit. All data is encrypted both in transit and at rest, so unauthorized users cannot intercept or read shared files.What happens if Anara experiences a data breach?In the unlikely event of a breach, our Incident Response Team will follow our documented IR playbook—identifying and containing the threat, notifying affected parties within 72 hours (or as legally required), and providing remediation guidance. We’ll also conduct a post-mortem to improve future defenses.Are my transcripts or summaries used to train AI models?No third-party AI vendor is permitted to use your data for model training. We only send temporary, encrypted text snippets to transcription providers, and they delete that data within 30 days.Do you support Single Sign-On (SSO)?Yes. Enterprise customers can configure SSO via SAML 2.0 or OAuth2. We integrate with popular identity providers. Audit logging and MFA enforcement are available through your identity provider.How long do you retain backups?We keep daily-encrypted database backups for 30 days. Old backups are securely deleted via automated retention policies. For files stored in object storage, older versions remain for 30 days before permanent deletion.Can I delete my account and all associated data?Yes. You can delete your account at any time by going to Settings → Account → Delete Account. After confirming deletion, your data will be queued for permanent deletion and removed from all active storage immediately.How can I report a security vulnerability?Please email any suspected vulnerabilities to security@anara.com. Include as much detail as possible (e.g., steps to reproduce, screenshots). Our team will respond within 48 hours to acknowledge receipt and keep you informed of remediation progress.\n​Additional Resources\n\nPrivacy Policy: For detailed information about data collection, processing, and sharing.\nTerms of Service: Governs your use of Anara.\n\nIf you have further questions or need clarification about our security practices, please reach out to our Security team at security@anara.com.

HOW LONG DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION?\nIn Short: We keep your information for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this privacy notice unless otherwise required by law.\nWe will only keep your personal information for as long as it is necessary for the purposes set out in this privacy notice, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law (such as tax, accounting, or other legal requirements). No purpose in this notice will require us keeping your personal information for longer than three (3) months past the termination of the user’s account.\nWhen we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymize such information, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.\n8.

You may also opt out of interest-based advertising by advertisers on our Services.\nIf you have questions or comments about your privacy rights, you may email us at support@anara.com.\n11. CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES\nMost web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a Do-Not-Track (“DNT”) feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your online browsing activities monitored and collected. At this stage no uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals has been finalized.

If a standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised version of this privacy notice.\n12.
