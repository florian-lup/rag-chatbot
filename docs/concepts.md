## Workspace

Your workspace is the central environment where all your research activities take place. It contains your library, chats, and all other Anara features you’ll use.

## Library

The library is where all your files are stored and organized. You can import documents, create notes, organize content into folders, and easily search through everything.

## Folders

Folders are your top level organizational containers, housing all your research projects or broad subject areas.

## Files

Files are the basic building blocks of content in Anara. They can be imported documents (like PDFs or PowerPoints), media (images, video, audio), or notes you write directly inside Anara. You can find a complete list of supported file types here.

## Agent

An AI that can read, write, make decisions and iterate through tasks to complete a specific goal. Find a full list of available agents here.

## Chat

Interface for AI conversations. Supports multiple tabs, conversation history, editing previously sent messages, and export functionality.

## Query

A request for information sent to Anara. Queries can be simple questions, complex research prompts, or text generations in the editor. They can include context from your files, web searches, or academic databases.

## Context

Information provided to AI models as part of a query. Includes files, symbols, and conversation history.

## Models

Different AI models available for text generation. Each model has different speed and capability characteristics.

## Metadata

Additional information about files shown in the right pane. This includes titles, creators, publishers, dates, page numbers, and any other data needed to cite the item.

## References

Formal academic references to source materials used in your research. Anara supports various citation styles (APA, MLA, Chicago, etc.) and helps maintain proper attribution throughout your work.

## Citations

Numbered citations in AI responses that link directly to source materials. When clicked, citations reveal the exact location of information, allowing you to verify accuracy, and ensure academic integrity throughout your research process.
